                <h1 style="margin-left: 150px">If Your Sun is in...</h1>
                <h2 style="margin-left: 150px">ARIES</h2>
                <h6 style="margin-left: 150px">Symbol: The Ram</h6>
              <p class="indent" style="padding-bottom: 10px">

                    You are a headstrong, fearless leader. Passionate and prone to acting first and thinking later. Some might
                call you arrogant, but when you're good, you're good. You are often first to take the initiative, but sometimes
            lack follow-through, as you can be easily distracted by shiny things, your latest hobby,
            the sound of your neighbor's sports car, or a sudden impulse to go skydiving. </p>

            <h2 style="margin-left: 150px">TAURUS</h2>
            <h6 style="margin-left: 150px">Symbol: The Bull</h6>
            <p class="indent" style="padding-bottom: 10px">

              You are earthy and stubborn. A lover of luxury and the finer things in life, sometimes you can be indulgent, but nobody
              works as hard as you do. Sensual and creative, with highly refined tastes. You appreciate beauty and art, and are drawn
              to that which is visually, sensorily, and aesthetically pleasing. Woe unto those who betray you, as your ability to hold
              a grudge is the stuff of legends.
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-left: 150px">GEMINI</h2>
            <h6 style="margin-left: 150px">Symbol: The Twins</h6>
            <p class="indent" style="padding-bottom: 10px">

              You are charming, gregarious, and have a wide social circle. Often the life of every party, in high school you were either
              the class clown, Student Body President, Homecoming Queen or King, or all of the above. There are two distinct sides to
              your personality. Which side someone must contend with
              usually depends on how they treat you. Your mind is a spectacular force of nature.
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-left: 150px">CANCER</h2>
            <h6 style="margin-left: 150px">Symbol: The Crab</h6>
            <p class="indent" style="padding-bottom: 10px">

              You are sensitive, prone to moodiness, and often swing
              between extreme fluctuations of temperament. Shrewd and resourceful, you can also be emotionally manipulative. Less evolved
              Cancer natives only tolerate people
              who obsequiously flatter them. You like to play the martyr. You are sweetly pleasant as long as things go your way. When scorned, your pincer-like claws can be vicious.
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-left: 150px">LEO</h2>
            <h6 style="margin-left: 150px">Symbol: The Lion</h6>
            <p class="indent" style="padding-bottom: 10px">

              You are stylish, often ridiculously good-looking, and always the center of attention. Seductive, alluring, and unnaturally lucky,
              you ooze charisma and sex appeal.
              Your natural magnetism is the Eighth Wonder of the World. Sometimes you can be a bit of a know-it-all, but
              it's usually because you're right. Even when you're wrong, most folks are too distracted by your blindingly dazzling radiance to notice.
              </p>

              <h2 style="margin-left: 150px">VIRGO</h2>
            <h6 style="margin-left: 150px">Symbol: The Virgin</h6>
            <p class="indent" style="padding-bottom: 10px">

              You are neat and orderly, methodical and well-organized. You excel in managing practical matters. You are
              impeccably groomed and pristine in your personal hygiene. Logic prevails over emotion in your decision-making processes.
              Straightforward, reliable, and true to your word. Your honesty is usually refreshing but sometimes can be brutal. At least people
              always know exactly where they stand.
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-left: 150px">LIBRA</h2>
            <h6 style="margin-left: 150px">Symbol: The Scales</h6>
            <p class="indent" style="padding-bottom: 10px">

              You are pleasant and attractive to the opposite sex. You like ideas and talking. The only sign of the zodiac to be represented by an inanimate object. You
              dislike it when anything threatens to disrupt the pretty picture of balance and seeming perfection in your world. You won't stand
              for anyone else rocking your proverbial boat, but if you decide to rock it yourself, you'll do it so forcefully it capsizes.
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-left: 150px">SCORPIO</h2>
            <h6 style="margin-left: 150px">Symbol: The Scorpion</h6>
            <p class="indent" style="padding-bottom: 10px">

              You are soulful, intense, erotic. Naturally inclined to investigate, you are a detective of sorts,
              renouncing the superficial in favor of probing deeper into the heart of any matter. You prefer to operate
              beneath a veil of secrecy, but only because life is more interesting that way. The intimate bonds you forge with others
              are powerful and permanent. You are intriguing and unforgettable.
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-left: 150px">SAGITTARIUS</h2>
            <h6 style="margin-left: 150px">Symbol: The Archer</h6>
            <p class="indent" style="padding-bottom: 10px">

              You are lively, intelligent, funny, and popular. Your fondness for both higher education and different cultures expresses
              itself either through a lifelong pursuit of learning and actual travel, or through binge-watching shows on Netflix that center
              on those subjects. You say what you mean and mean what you say. People find you so wildly appealing, you always have many
              suitors from which to choose.
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-left: 150px">CAPRICORN</h2>
            <h6 style="margin-left: 150px">Symbol: The Sea Goat</h6>
            <p class="indent" style="padding-bottom: 10px">

              You are tenacious and hardworking. "Determined" is your middle name. You are often preoccupied with achieving
              a social status of prominence and the accumulation of significant personal wealth. Whatever your occupation happens to
              be, you want to be recognized for being the best at doing what you do. You want to build an empire and create a lasting legacy
              for your heirs. You like sarcasm.
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-left: 150px">AQUARIUS</h2>
            <h6 style="margin-left: 150px">Symbol: The Water Bearer</h6>
            <p class="indent" style="padding-bottom: 10px">

              You are quirky, innovative, brilliant, and unconventional. Sometimes you think so far outside the box that the box actually
              implodes. Visionary and perpetually inspired, you are a genius in your own right. You often march to the beat of your own drum,
              but you look so damn good doing it that it goes viral on Tik Tok and becomes an overnight global sensation. Your ideas are fire, and
              your heart is pure.
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-left: 150px">PISCES</h2>
            <h6 style="margin-left: 150px">Symbol: The Fishes</h6>
            <p class="indent" style="padding-bottom: 10px">

              You are alluring, captivating, and mysterious. The zodiac's mystical mermaid/merman. Chameleon-like, you have an uncanny ability to morph into whatever someone needs you to be.
              Your emotional depth is unparalleled. Lovers find you endlessly fascinating. The other dual sign. Whether someone experiences the gentle dolphin or
              the flesh-eating barracuda depends entirely on how they treat you.

            </p>
