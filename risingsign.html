            Your rising sign is determined by your birth date, location, and your accurate birth time, as it
            changes zodiac signs approximately every two hours. Technically speaking, it's the zodiac sign that was rising or ascending
            on the eastern horizon the moment you were born. The rising sign sets up the pie-shaped structure of the 12 houses in your
            birth chart and informs your chart ruler.
        </p>
        <p>Essentially, your rising sign is your public persona, the "hat" or "costume" you wear when people first meet you. It is
            how you initially appear to others, the first impression that you make. In some ways, it is a facade, for it is not who we truly
            are deep within ourselves, at our core -- the nature of our real, true essence is described by our Sun sign -- but rather, the
            ascendant sign describes how we present ourselves to the external world and how we wish to be seen.

        <h6 style="margin-left: 150px">Symbol: The Ram</h6>
      <p class="indent" style="padding-bottom: 10px">

        You were born with the first sign of the zodiac on your ascendant, making Mars your ruling planet and an important
        part of your natal chart. Yours is considered the "natural" chart.
        Even if your Sun sign is in an earth, air, or water element, you come across as pure fire due to your Aries rising qualities.

        passionate air about you. Aries is a cardinal fire sign symbolized by the sturdy Ram, giving you a pioneering spirit. You are often
        seen as a trailblazer and someone who is unafraid to take risks. You are known for your boundless enthusiasm and competitive nature.

      <p class="indent" style="padding-bottom: 10px">
        Taurus rising natives are often rather stubborn and fixed in their ways. If you are a Taurus rising, then it can
        be quite difficult to sway you. By nature, you are resistant to change. You possess a determined
        single-mindedness. Security is one of your foremost considerations before undertaking anything new. You have a
        well-developed sense of smell and touch, and respond to the material world. Yours is a practical approach to
        life. A lover of luxury and all of the finer things, you place a lot of value on your material possessions.
        Taurus rising natives are often collectors of some kind. You have a stability about you that is soothing and an
        inner harmony that is attractive, so you are very comforting to be around. You prefer to wear comfortable clothes
        that feel good against your skin. You are likely to be possessive in your personal relationships. Loyalty is very
        important to you. Famous Taurus risings include Queen Latifah, George Lucas, Liza Minnelli, Nick Nolte, Billy

        <h6 style="margin-left: 150px">Symbol: The Twins</h6>
      <p class="indent" style="padding-bottom: 10px">

        You have an innate ability to communicate effectively and connect with almost anyone. Mercury, the closest
        planet to the Sun and the ruler of communication, writing, speech, and intellect, is also the ruler of your chart. You are endowed
        with a warm demeanor, natural inquisitiveness, versatility, and a sharp intellect. You are not one for emotional displays and
        tend to use logic to navigate your reality. You are a social butterfly who loves new environments, exchanging ideas, and a variety of
        information. You are childlike, funny, and playful. People are drawn to your charming disposition and curiosity. You are adaptable,
        which sometimes translates into being indecisive or a "fence-sitter." You easily switch between different personas, and you can be
        plagued by a sense of restlessness. Famous Gemini risings include Lady Gaga, Sarah Jessica Parker, LeBron James, Kristen Stewart,
        Willow Smith, Sandra Bullock, Lindsay Lohan, Dua Lipa, and Drew Barrymore.

      <h2 style="margin-left: 150px">CANCER</h2>
        <h6 style="margin-left: 150px">Symbol: The Crab</h6>
      <p class="indent" style="padding-bottom: 10px">

        You can be nurturing, motivated by security, and focused on protecting yourself. Cancer is a cardinal water sign, and the Moon is
        the ruler of your chart. You can come across to others as compassionate, empathetic, and in touch with your feelings. You can also
        be quite moody and reactive, and easily affected by those around you. This is especially true if you haven't gained the wisdom
        needed to detach and distinguish your own feelings from others. Sometimes others perceive you as being reserved, shy, or cautious.
        Famous Cancer risings include Angelina Jolie, Julia Roberts, Cameron Diaz, Adele, The Weeknd, Ben Affleck, Victoria Beckham, Meghan
        Markle, Margot Robbie, Tyra Banks, Cindy Crawford, and Pharrell Williams.

        There is a quiet charm to many Virgo rising people. You have an intelligent and reserved aura that is unmistakable.
