        <hr class="solid">
        <p class="indent" style="padding-bottom: 10px">

            In astrology, your rising sign is the portal through which you perceive the external world. Your rising sign,
            or ascendant, governs elements of your appearance as well as the manifestation of your outward personality. It is also the first
            impression you give to others. Think of it as your facade, the natural mask to which you default when you're with
            unfamiliar people, in unfamiliar places and situations. When you walk into a room, you are radiating the qualities of your
            rising sign. If you are a Leo sun with a Scorpio rising, then although you are a Leo at heart and people will
            get to know that lion or lioness within, when people meet you for the first time, they meet a Scorpio. The
            presentation of the personality, as determined by the ascendant, always precedes the presentation of one's true
            essence -- what one is at one's core, what is at the center of your being.</p>

        </p>
        <p>
        Your rising sign is determined by your birth date, location, and your accurate birth time, as it
        changes zodiac signs approximately every two hours. Technically speaking, it's the zodiac sign that was rising or ascending
        on the eastern horizon the moment you were born. The rising sign sets up the pie-shaped structure of the 12 houses in your
        birth chart and informs your chart ruler.



        <p>Essentially, your rising sign is your public persona, the "hat" or "costume" you wear when people first meet you. It is
            how you initially appear to others, the first impression that you make. In some ways, it is a facade, for it is not who we truly
            are deep within ourselves, at our core -- the nature of our real, true essence is described by our Sun sign -- but rather, the
            ascendant sign describes how we present ourselves to the external world and how we wish to be seen.

        You were born with the first sign of the zodiac on your ascendant, making Mars your ruling planet and an important
        part of your natal chart. Yours is considered the "natural" chart.
        Even if your Sun sign is in an earth, air, or water element, you come across as pure fire due to your Aries rising qualities.
        Your personality conveys drive, action, raw sexuality, impulsivity, and confident zeal. You have a natural assertiveness and
        passionate air about you. Aries is a cardinal fire sign symbolized by the sturdy Ram, giving you a pioneering spirit. You are often
        seen as a trailblazer and someone who is unafraid to take risks. You are known for your boundless enthusiasm and competitive nature.

      <p class="indent" style="padding-bottom: 10px">
        Taurus rising natives are often rather stubborn and fixed in their ways. If you are a Taurus rising, then it can
        be quite difficult to sway you. By nature, you are resistant to change. You possess a determined
        single-mindedness. Security is one of your foremost considerations before undertaking anything new. You have a
        well-developed sense of smell and touch, and respond to the material world. Yours is a practical approach to
        life. A lover of luxury and all of the finer things, you place a lot of value on your material possessions.
        Taurus rising natives are often collectors of some kind. You have a stability about you that is soothing and an
        inner harmony that is attractive, so you are usually very pleasant to be around. You prefer to wear comfortable clothes
        that feel good against your skin. You are likely to be possessive in your personal relationships. Loyalty is
        important to you. Famous Taurus risings include Queen Latifah, George Lucas, Denise Richards, Ashley Tisdale, Danny Trejo,
        David Letterman, Linda Blair, Cate Blanchett, Miley Cyrus, David Beckham, Mae West, Gary Cooper, Roddy McDowall,
        Elle MacPherson, Wayne Newton, Bobby Darin, Miles Davis, Trisha Yearwood, Halle Berry, Eliza Dushku, Robert Pattinson, Melanie Griffith,

      <p class="indent" style="padding-bottom: 10px">

        You have an innate ability to communicate effectively and connect with almost anyone. Mercury, the closest
        planet to the Sun and the ruler of communication, writing, speech, and intellect, is also the ruler of your chart. You are endowed
        with a warm demeanor, natural inquisitiveness, versatility, and a sharp intellect. You are not one for emotional displays and
        tend to use logic to navigate your reality. You are a social butterfly who loves new environments, exchanging ideas, and a variety of
        information. You are childlike, funny, and playful. People are drawn to your charming disposition and curiosity. You are adaptable,
        which sometimes translates into being indecisive or a "fence-sitter." You easily switch between different personas, and you can be
        plagued by a sense of restlessness. Famous Gemini risings include Lady Gaga, Sarah Jessica Parker, Amy Adams, LeBron James, Kristen Stewart,
        Willow Smith, Christina Applegate, Minka Kelly, Lisa Rinna, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Will Smith, Bryan Cranston, Ben Stiller, Rose McGowan,

      <h2 style="margin-left: 150px">CANCER</h2>
        <h6 style="margin-left: 150px">Symbol: The Crab</h6>
      <p class="indent" style="padding-bottom: 10px">

        You can be nurturing, motivated by security, and focused on protecting yourself. Cancer is a cardinal water sign, and the Moon is
        the ruler of your chart. You can come across to others as compassionate, empathetic, and in touch with your feelings. You can also
        be quite moody and reactive, and easily affected by those around you. This is especially true if you haven't gained the wisdom
        needed to detach and distinguish your own feelings from others. Ascendant in Cancer represents
     an outwardly caring spirit that can draw people to them,
        and a sensitive demeanor that appears attuned to the emotions of others. Sometimes others perceive you as being
        reserved, shy, or cautious. When everything in your world is rosy, you are excellent at making people feel at home.
        When the emotional pendulum swings in the opposite direction, you can be intentionally quite destructive.
        Famous Cancer risings include Angelina Jolie, Julia Roberts, Robert De Niro, Rami Malek, Matt LeBlanc, Jack Black,
        Miranda Kerr, James Stewart, John Cena, Elon Musk, Kurt Russell, Rob Zombie, Molly Ringwald, Steven Spielberg,
        Kenneth Branagh, Lisa Kudrow, Liv Tyler, Kate Hudson, Cameron Diaz, Adele, The Weeknd, Ben Affleck, Victoria Beckham, Meghan
        Markle, Margot Robbie, Tyra Banks, and Cindy Crawford.

        <h6 style="margin-left: 150px">Symbol: The Lion</h6>
      <p class="indent" style="padding-bottom: 10px">
        Drama comes naturally to you. Leo rising people cannot help but be noticed. You radiate a special energy and
        have a natural magnetism that easily attracts attention. You are very self-aware and body-conscious. You might be
        prone to rash decision-making, temper tantrums, and general excess. However, you also have plenty of staying
        power and drive, and your idealism keeps things light and also helps to keep you from getting into too much trouble.
        You have a strong authoritarian manner and a youthful appearance, regardless of your actual age.
        You have a natural flair for presentation, an eye for quality, and a hard-to-resist warmth of style. You are warm,
        fun-loving, often childlike in an endearing way, generous and spirited. You have an unusual need to be
        admired. Famous Leo risings include Justin Timberlake, Drake, Kirsten Dunst, Matthew Perry, Vanessa Hudgens, Blake

        <h6 style="margin-left: 150px">Symbol: The Virgin</h6>
      <p class="indent" style="padding-bottom: 10px">
        There is a quiet charm to many Virgo rising people. You have an intelligent and reserved aura that is unmistakable.
        You might be exceptionally particular about food. Even if your appetite is generally good, you are likely to be very picky
        about what you put into your body. You are probably quite focused on physical health and might take a special
        interest in the mind-body connection. You notice the tiniest details often overlooked by others. You may have a
        tendency to worry a lot, especially when confronted with new people and situations. You tend to appear rather collected
        and professional. There is often something scholarly in your appearance; your natural demeanor may carry an air
        of academia in some way. Others perceive you as being highly intellectually gifted. Regardless of your actual
        profession, you look like a teacher, an author, a scholar, or otherwise someone who is a genius in their chosen field. Famous

      <p class="indent" style="padding-bottom: 10px">
        Libra Rising people don't know what to do with themselves without a significant other. If you are a Libra rising
        native, you can be enormously persuasive, although you will almost always use a “soft sell” approach
        when you want to win others over, which is all of the time! A tendency to pass the buck and keep up that “nice
        guy/gal” image can be amongst your worst qualities. However, you can make excellent mediators, when you want to,
        and will generally be the first to accommodate others, or at least give the appearance of doing so. Libra rising
        natives are usually attracted to competent, active partners. Their relationships are often characterized by
        bickering or competitiveness until they learn to drop their sweet image once in a while and to stop blaming
        their partners for everything that goes wrong. It's certainly a pretty facade, but don't make the mistake of
        underestimating the subtle cruel streak simmering just beneath the surface of things. Famous Libra risings include
        Britney Spears, Denzel Washington, Harrison Ford, Rose Byrne, Ewan MacGregor, Vince Vaughn, James Garner,
        Frank Sinatra, Jennifer Aniston, Anne Heche, Leonardo DiCaprio, John Ritter, Courtney Love, Lea Thompson, Ellen Burstyn,

        <h6 style="margin-left: 150px">Symbol: The Scorpion</h6>
      <p class="indent" style="padding-bottom: 10px">
        Scorpio rising people are intense, loyal, protective, and sometimes a bit possessive. If you are a Scorpio rising
        native, you have a keen instinct for self-preservation, and you unearth every secret. You are the natural detective
        of the zodiac. You are enigmatic, with a depth of emotion and perception that can be quite captivating. You have a
        commanding presence and profound intuition. The sign of Scorpio is associated with the eighth house, and therefore
        rules over taboo facets of life such as sex, intimacy, death, rebirth, transformation, and what is hidden or concealed.
        You are intensely passionate and constantly yearn for deeply transformative connections. You likely possess deep-set,
        penetrating eyes that seem to see right through every veneer, straight to the heart of a person. The intensity of your
        gaze is difficult to ignore. You navigate a room slowly,
        deliberately, and with an unmistakable smoldering intensity. You give off a moody, powerful vibe that is an irresistible
        pull, drawing others to you in a  seemingly effortless manner.
        Some say yours is the most alluring and magnetic ascendant of them all. Famous Scorpio risings include Taylor Swift,
        Halsey, Janet Jackson, Justin Beiber, Mitski, Katy Perry, Natalie Portman, Martha Stewart, Frank Ocean, Lana Del
        Rey, Jaden Smith, Lily-Rose Depp, Sean Penn, Daniel Craig, Ashley Benson, Paulina Porizkova, James Gandolfini, Chris Evans,

      <p class="indent" style="padding-bottom: 10px">
        Sagittarius rising people have opinions on everything, and they love to share them! If you are a Sagittarius rising,
        you are somewhat restless and often active, always searching for something beyond your immediate environment. This
        infuses you with a constant sense of wanderlust, so you are likely quite the jet-setter. Even if you do not physically travel
        to different geographic locations,
        then you are probably prone to taking frequent mental flights of fancy. Some might call you a daydreamer.
        The world is filled with adventure, new things to experience, and, most of all, hope, with this Ascendant. There is an
        unmistakable faith and enthusiasm with Sagittarius Rising people. Grand schemes, big promises, and a willingness to
        explore and experiment are themes, although follow-through is not a strong characteristic of Sagittarius. You can be very
        direct, even blunt at times, but you are so likable that people often take it in stride and choose to appreciate  the
        constructive criticism contained within your verbal roast. You have a lot to say and offer.
        Your insights and opinions are usually interesting and exciting,
        although sometimes lacking in details. You exude confidence and charisma. You are usually optimistic and have a great sense of
        humor. Famous Sagittarius risings include Jodie Foster, Scarlett Johansson, Vera Farmiga, Jada Pinkett-Smith, Sarah
        Silverman, Isabella Rosellini, Paris Hilton, Shania Twain, Brad Pitt, Princess Diana, Sean Penn, Sylvester Stallone,

        If you are a Capricorn rising, you likely have a serious demeanor, even when you are joking around.
        Your jokes are usually either sarcastic or of the deadpan variety of humor. You appear responsible, and exude competence. People around you know
        they can count on you to get the job done. Tradition, family, and structure are the predominant keywords for you, and you come across
        as hardworking and dependable. You are driven, sometimes to the point of compulsion. Security is essential. You are
        perpetually striving for success and material rewards. You are easily able to trim away excess and do away with
        frivolity. Your practical nature is strong. More often than not, Capricorn rising people are success stories, having
        endured trials and tribulations in childhood. You age gracefully and beautifully, as Capricorn is ruled by Saturn,
        and Saturn prefers maturity over youth. Famous Capricorn risings include Ariana Grande, Kylie Jenner,

        You might be quietly provocative and irreverent if you are an Aquarius rising. You are highly unique and prize your
        individuality. Always original and innovative, you possess intellectual poise and savvy. You perpetually have your
        finger on the pulse of what's trending, and an uncanny knack for predicting (and setting!) trends before they happen. You are curious
        and quite learned, often particularly in the fields of both science and metaphysics. Anything that involves advancement
        of the human race holds much appeal for you. You are quite likable and friendly. You have many personality quirks,
        but others find them to be mostly endearing. You exude a cool and detached demeanor, which others find appealing. You
        sometimes enjoy deploying the shock factor, or at least stirring the proverbial pot. You can get away with wearing
        literally anything, because everything looks good on you. Famous Aquarius risings include Nicki Minaj, Christina Aguilera,

      <p class="indent" style="padding-bottom: 10px">

        Pisces rising people appear deeply emotional and sensitive, enshrouded in mystery. Pisces risings are born with
        the 12th and final sign of the zodiac on their ascendant. If you are a Pisces rising, spiritual Jupiter and
        illusory Neptune are the planetary rulers of your birth chart. This cosmic influence bestows you with a perpetual
        yearning to connect with realms beyond reality. Fantasy is your specialty, and you are a real maestro with that glittery
        pink smoke and mirrors routine. Your magnificent ability to create a fantasy world is one of the many ways you
        are blessed with an uncanny ability to lure your lovers in, hook, line, and sinker, even if they are initially reticent, already
        attached, or otherwise unavailable. The symbol for Pisces is two
        fishes joined at the tail but swimming in opposite directions, representing duality and the connection between the
        imaginary world and physical reality. You possess a natural ability to connect with the energies of others, so be mindful
        of the company you keep and avoid energy vampires. Your emotional intelligence is superior to that of most other
        humans. You have a gentle demeanor and are sometimes elusive. You likely find solace in the arts or healing modalities
        as a means to channel your vivid inner world. Famous Pisces risings include Billie Eilish, Ryan
        Gosling, Whitney Houston, Mena Suvari, Krysten Ritter, Bette Paige, Michael Jackson, Allen Ginsberg, Jay-Z, Vladimir
        Nabokov, Kourtney Kardashian, Demi Moore, Gwyneth Paltrow, Johnny Cash, Deepak Chopra, John Madden, Tony Hawk, Ashlee Simpson,
        Robert Redford, Antonio Banderas, Mario
        López, Kaley Cuoco, Laura Dern, Allison Janning, Mary Tyler Moore, Phylicia Rashad, and Alicia Keys.
